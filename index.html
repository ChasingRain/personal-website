      <hr>
      <p>I've always wanted a place to keep a personal journal of stories, notes,
        ideas, coding projects, and a record of adventures. I am thankful for the
        life I get to live, and I'd like to share it with the world. Enjoy!</p>

      <hr>
      <p>I spent most of my younger years making memories in Norris, Tennessee.
        We lived right down the street from the antique mall and East Tennessee's
         top Bluegrass station, WDVX.<br><br>
As a kid, my parents loved taking us down the Clinch River which is where I
initally fell in love with the river. I had no idea what impact those experiences
 would have on my life, but they have definitely led me down a path of adventure
 and exploration.<br><br><img class="pimageleft" src="images/gymnastics.jpg" alt="">
In high schoool, I got serious about gymnastics. Working up the ranks towards a
college scholarship. In 2008 a Blue Chip recruit for the US Air Force Academy's
gymnastics team, and eventually settled as a pommel horse specialist after multiple
 shoulder surgeries. Our sophomore year, the Air Force Academy won it's first USAG
 National Championchip. During that same competion I was also able to set the new
 AFA Pommel Horse Record.<br><br><img class="pimageright" src="images/skook.jpg" style="width:300px;" alt="">
During my sophomore year at the academy, I also fell in love with whitewater
kayaking. I haad dreams to become a sponsored professional whitewater paddler,
and eventually dropped out of the academy to pursue that dream. I eventually
earned multiple kayaking sponsorships and finished my business management degree
with a minor in entrepreneurship at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs.
During school I was coaching at a local gym and started my first company manufacturing
 gymnastics equipment. Living the dream.<br><br>
After my last final exam I moved to Seattle with the love of my life and future
wife, Kala. <img class="pimageleft" src="images/kala.jpg" alt="">We got engaged during the move on a 100 mile river trip on the Middle
Fork of the Salmon River in Idaho. Best decision I've ever made.<br><br>
After moving to Seattle, I realized the job I had accepted was not what I was
hoping for. I immediately started to work side a hustle. It was here, Fall 2013,
 when I met my current business partner, Mike Gordon. We started a cannabis tourism
  company called Kush Tourism which was the beginning of a long journey which has
  lead to our most exciting project, Kush Marketplace.<br><br>
I have many stories I look forward to sharing, and I hope you enjoy them!</p>
